# Models

This directory contains the generated models for the associated paper. Each model type has its own directory.

Each model directory contains two subdirectories: one contining models for a single initial condition and different model hyperparameters and one contiaining models for different initial conditions and fixed hyperparameters. The only exception is the exact model, since it does not contain hyperparameters and its initial conditions are specified when the model is run in PRISM.
