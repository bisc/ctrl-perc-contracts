# Mper

This directory contains the code to generate the Mper components of various model types.

The per-mdl-bundling directory computes the model transition probabilites based on simulation data, previous detections and bundling parameters.

The statefulLEC directory contains the code to generate the PRISM models based on the transition probabilites and Mcp model type.
