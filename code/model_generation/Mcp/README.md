This directory contains the code to generate the various models.

Note that the exact model and discrete baseline model use the same code for generation, since they only differ on the distance discretization parameter. In addition, the basic abstraction and Fail-Late Distance-Velocity No-Bundling models share the same code, with just the rounding variable changing (0 is basic abstraction, 1 is Fail-Late Distance-Velocity No-Bundling)
